1/ Standardization of the data, transforming the input data to allow for an offset weight. We also add a column consisting of the squares of the values of the most significant feature
2/ A cross-validation process allowed us to determine that the best technique we had was a SGD on the whole dataset
3/ SGD with a max_iters of 50.000
