    <li>Standardization of the data, transforming the input data to allow for an offset weight. We also add a column consisting of the squares of the values of the most significant feature</li>
    <li>A cross-validation process allowed us to determine that the best technique we had was a SGD on the whole dataset</li>
    <li>SGD with a max_iters of 50.000</li>
